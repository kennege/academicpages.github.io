I am a Masters candidate at the Australian National University and the <a href="https://www.roboticvision.org/">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony">Rob Mahony</a>.
My research involves developing novel deep learning algorithms for applications in robotic vision.
A particular application I have focused on is object position and orientation (pose) estimation of crops for agricultural robotics.
I began my candidature in 2019 and expect to submit my thesis in February 2021.

Prior to this I spent a year working as Research Assistant, again with the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision under the supervision of Rob Mahony.
In this role I assisted in the development of a robotic harvester for green asparagus crops.
I also assisted in research aimed at developing a novel simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm.

I have also obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree majoring in Mechatronic Engineering and Systems Engineering, and a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Mathematics.
Both from the Australian National University.

When I'm not studying I enjoy getting outdoors for activities including rock climbing and highlining.
