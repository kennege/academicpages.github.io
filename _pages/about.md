I am a Masters candidate at the Australian National University and the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision under the supervision of <u><a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony">Rob Mahony</a>.</u>.
My research involves developing novel deep learning algorithms for applications in robotic vision.
I began this program in 2019 and expect to submit my thesis in February 2021.
