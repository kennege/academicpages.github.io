I am a Masters candidate at the Australian National University and the <u><a href="https://www.roboticvision.org/">Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</a>.</u> under the supervision of <u><a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony">Rob Mahony</a>.</u>.
My research involves developing novel deep learning algorithms for applications in robotic vision.
A particular application I have focused on is crop detection for agricultural robotics.
I began this program in 2019 and expect to submit my thesis in February 2021.

Prior to this I spent a year working as Research
