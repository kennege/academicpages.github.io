During lockdown in 2021 I decided to try and learn some web development, something that I've always wanted to do.
I chose to develop a simple budgeting calculator, based on a spreadsheet I have been using.
The site is therefore a tool for me, but hopefully others will find it useful too!

The site was developed from scratch without any frameworks (mainly because I don't know any yet and thought it best to start with the basics).
There's only a front end, so development was done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is live at <a href="www.simplebudgetcalculator.com" target="_blank"><b>www.simplebudgetcalculator.com</b></a>&emsp;>, and the code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/kennege/SimpleBudgetCalculator" target="_blank"><b>Github</b></a>&emsp;>.

I really enjoyed the process of learning and then writing this page. I expect it will be the first of many websites I develop in the near future!
