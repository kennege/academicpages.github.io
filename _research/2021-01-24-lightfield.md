My undergraduate thesis explored the possibilities of utilising the Lytro light-field camera for video applications.
I developed a software package that remotely triggered the Lytro while simultaneously moving a robotic arm that was holding the camera.
This software allows for the capture of light-field datasets where the position and orientation of the camera is known for each frame.

The software package is available <a href="https://github.com/kennege/Lytro-Remote-Shutter" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
