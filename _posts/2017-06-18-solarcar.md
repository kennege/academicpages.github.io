I was part of the team for the Australian National University's (ANU) first entry in the <a href="https://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank"><b>World Solar Car Challenge</b></a>. 
Our team successfully completed the race and achieved a top 20 result in a competitive field.

I was on the Control sub-team, and my tasks included developing the car's data logger (in C\#), and designing printed circuit boards (PCB) for the car's steering wheel, throttle control, and battery mount. 
I designed these boards using Altium Designer. 
Illustrations of the designs are provided below.
