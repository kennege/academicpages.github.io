In 2018 I spent a year working as a Research Assistant with the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision at the Australian National University.
During this time the main project that I was involved in focused on the development of a prototype robotic harvester for green asparagus.
My role involved developing a vision system that would enable the robotic to detect and localise asparagus spears that were ready for harvest.
